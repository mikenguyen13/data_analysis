|              | Control (0)        | Treated (1)         |
|--------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| **Pre (0)**  | $\bar{Y}_{00} = 5$ | $\bar{Y}_{10} = 8$  |
| **Post (1)** | $\bar{Y}_{01} = 7$ | $\bar{Y}_{11} = 14$ |

The table organizes the mean outcomes into four cells:

1.  Control Group, Pre-period ($\bar{Y}_{00}$): Mean outcome for the control group before the intervention.

2.  Control Group, Post-period ($\bar{Y}_{01}$): Mean outcome for the control group after the intervention.

3.  Treated Group, Pre-period ($\bar{Y}_{10}$): Mean outcome for the treated group before the intervention.

4.  Treated Group, Post-period ($\bar{Y}_{11}$): Mean outcome for the treated group after the intervention.

The treatment effect is calculated as:

$\text{DID} = (\bar{Y}_{11} - \bar{Y}_{10}) - (\bar{Y}_{01} - \bar{Y}_{00})$

Using the simulated table:

$\text{DID} = (14 - 8) - (7 - 5) = 6 - 2 = 4$

This matches the **interaction term coefficient** ($\beta_3 = 4$) from the OLS regression.

**Understanding Diff-in-Diff: The Formula and OLS**

Did you know the Difference-in-Differences (DID) treatment effect calculated from the simple formula of averages is identical to the estimate from an OLS regression with an interaction term?

Here's a detailed breakdown with R code and visuals to prove it.

Compute manually:

$(\bar{Y}_{11} - \bar{Y}_{10}) - (\bar{Y}_{01} - \bar{Y}_{00})$

Use OLS regression:

$Y_{it} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{treated}_i + \beta_2 \text{time}_t + \beta_3 (\text{treated}_i \cdot \text{time}_t) + \epsilon_{it}$

The interaction term coefficient ($\beta_3$) is the treatment effect.

Both methods give the same result!
