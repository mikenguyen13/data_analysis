# Appendix

## Git

This appendix provides a concise reference to essential Git concepts and commands, tailored for data analysts and researchers managing code and collaboration. For extended learning, explore the following resources:

- [Git Cheat Sheet (PDF)](https://training.github.com/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf)
- [Git Cheat Sheets in Other Languages](https://training.github.com/)
- [Interactive Git Tutorial](http://try.github.io/)
- [Visual Git Cheat Sheet](http://ndpsoftware.com/git-cheatsheet.html#loc=remote_repo;)
- [Happy Git with R (for R Users)](https://happygitwithr.com/)

---

### Basic Setup

Configure your Git environment using the `git config` command:

- Set your name and email (used in commits):
  
  ```bash
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"
  git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
  ```

* Set your preferred text editor (e.g., for writing commit messages):

  ```bash
  git config --global core.editor "code --wait"  # VS Code
  ```

---

### Creating a Repository

To create a new Git repository in your project directory:

```bash
git init
```

This creates a `.git` directory where Git stores all version control information.

---

### Tracking Changes

Git tracks changes through a three-tier structure:

* **Working Directory**: your local folder with files.
* **Staging Area**: where you prepare changes before committing.
* **Local Repository**: stores committed snapshots of your code.

Common commands:

* Check status:

  ```bash
  git status
  ```

* Add files to the staging area:

  ```bash
  git add filename
  git add .  # Add all changes
  ```

* Commit staged changes:

  ```bash
  git commit -m "A brief message describing the change"
  ```

---

### Viewing History and Changes

* Show changes not yet staged:

  ```bash
  git diff
  ```

* Show committed changes:

  ```bash
  git log
  ```

* Restore previous versions of files:

  ```bash
  git checkout HEAD filename  # Restore last committed version
  git checkout <commit-id> filename  # Restore from specific commit
  ```

---

### Ignoring Files

To prevent certain files from being tracked by Git, create a `.gitignore` file. For example:

```bash
# .gitignore
*.dat
results/
```

* View contents using:

  ```bash
  cat .gitignore
  ```

---

### Remote Repositories

Git supports linking local and remote repositories (e.g., GitHub):

* Add a remote:

  ```bash
  git remote add origin https://github.com/yourname/repo.git
  ```

* Push changes to remote:

  ```bash
  git push origin main  # or 'master' depending on default branch
  ```

* Pull changes from remote:

  ```bash
  git pull origin main
  ```

---

### Collaboration

* Clone a remote repository:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
  ```

  This creates a local copy and sets up a remote named `origin`.

---

### Branching and Merging

* Create and switch to a new branch:

  ```bash
  git checkout -b new-branch-name
  ```

* Switch back to main branch:

  ```bash
  git checkout main
  ```

* Merge another branch into the current one:

  ```bash
  git merge feature-branch
  ```

---

### Handling Conflicts

Merge conflicts occur when multiple changes affect the same lines of a file. Git will:

* Mark the conflict in the file.
* Require manual resolution before committing.

Always review and test code after resolving conflicts.

---

### Licensing

Understanding software licensing is essential in open-source collaboration:

* **GPL (General Public License)**: Requires derivative software to also be GPL-licensed.
* **Creative Commons**: Offers flexible combinations of attribution, sharing, and commercial use restrictions.

Choose licenses aligned with your intended use and contributions.

---

### Citing Repositories

To guide citation practices:

* Include a `CITATION` file in your repository.
* Provide preferred citation formats (e.g., BibTeX, DOI).

This helps others acknowledge your work in academic or professional settings.

---

### Hosting and Legal Considerations

Whether hosted on GitHub, GitLab, or institutional servers:

* Respect intellectual property.
* Avoid storing sensitive or personal data in version control.
* Follow organizational or institutional data security policies.

## Short-cut

These are shortcuts that you probably you remember when working with R. Even though it might take a bit of time to learn and use them as your second nature, but they will save you a lot of time.\
Just like learning another language, the more you speak and practice it, the more comfortable you are speaking it.\

| function                                         | short-cut                 |
|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| navigate folders in console                      | `" " + tab`               |
| pull up short-cut cheat sheet                    | `ctrl + shift + k`        |
| go to file/function (everything in your project) | `ctrl + .`                |
| search everything                                | `cmd + shift + f`         |
| navigate between tabs                            | `Crtl + shift + .`        |
| type function faster                             | `snip + shift + tab`      |
| type faster                                      | `use tab for fuzzy match` |
| `cmd + up`                                       |                           |
| `ctrl + .`                                       |                           |

Sometimes you can't stage a folder because it's too large. In such case, use `Terminal` pane in Rstudio then type `git add -A` to stage all changes then commit and push like usual.

## Function short-cut

apply one function to your data to create a new variable: `mutate(mod=map(data,function))`\
instead of using `i in 1:length(object)`: `for (i in seq_along(object))`\
apply multiple function: `map_dbl`\
apply multiple function to multiple variables:`map2`\
`autoplot(data)` plot times series data\
`mod_tidy = linear(reg) %>% set_engine('lm') %>% fit(price ~ ., data=data)` fit lm model. It could also fit other models (stan, spark, glmnet, keras)

-   Sometimes, data-masking will not be able to recognize whether you're calling from environment or data variables. To bypass this, we use `.data$variable` or `.env$variable`. For example `data %>% mutate(x=.env$variable/.data$variable`\
-   Problems with data-masking:\
    + Unexpected masking by data-var: Use `.data` and `.env` to disambiguate\
    + Data-var cant get through:\
    + Tunnel data-var with {{}} + Subset `.data` with [[]]
-   Passing Data-variables through arguments


``` r
library("dplyr")
mean_by <- function(data,by,var){
    data %>%
        group_by({{{by}}}) %>%
        summarise("{{var}}":=mean({{var}})) # new name for each var will be created by tunnel data-var inside strings
}

mean_by <- function(data,by,var){
    data %>%
        group_by({{{by}}}) %>%
        summarise("{var}":=mean({{var}})) # use single {} to glue the string, but hard to reuse code in functions
}
```

-   Trouble with selection:\


``` r
library("purrr")
name <- c("mass","height")
starwars %>% select(name) # Data-var. Here you are referring to variable named "name"

starwars %>% select(all_of((name))) # use all_of() to disambiguate when 

averages <- function(data,vars){ # take character vectors with all_of()
    data %>%
        select(all_of(vars)) %>%
        map_dbl(mean,na.rm=TRUE)
} 

x = c("Sepal.Length","Petal.Length")
iris %>% averages(x)


# Another way
averages <- function(data,vars){ # Tunnel selectiosn with {{}}
    data %>%
        select({{vars}}) %>%
        map_dbl(mean,na.rm=TRUE)
} 

x = c("Sepal.Length","Petal.Length")
iris %>% averages(x)
```


## Citation

To cite the R packages used during this session, the following code prints BibTeX-formatted citations:


``` r
# List all non-base packages loaded in the session
packages <- ls(sessionInfo()$loadedOnly)

# Print BibTeX citations for each package
for (pkg in packages) {
  print(toBibtex(citation(pkg)))
}
```

You may wish to redirect this output to a `.bib` file for integration with LaTeX or R Markdown documents using `writeLines()`.

# Export the list to a CSV file
write.csv(installed$Package, file = file.path(getwd(), "installed.csv"), row.names = FALSE)
```

### Step 2: Install Packages on a New Machine

Once you have transferred the `installed.csv` file to the new machine, run the following code to install any missing packages.


``` r
# Read the list of required packages
required <- read.csv("installed.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)$Package

# Get the list of already installed packages on the current machine
current <- installed.packages()[, "Package"]

# Identify packages that are not yet installed
missing <- setdiff(required, current)

# Install the missing packages
install.packages(missing)
```

> ⚠️ Note: This approach assumes that all packages are available from CRAN. For packages from GitHub or Bioconductor, use `devtools::install_github()` or `BiocManager::install()` as appropriate.

This approach ensures a reproducible computational environment, which is essential for robust data analysis and collaboration.
