### Proxy Variables {#sec-proxy-variables}

In applied business and economic analysis, we often confront a frustrating reality: the variables we truly care about---like *brand loyalty*, *employee ability*, or *investor sentiment*---are not directly observable. Instead, we rely on **proxy variables**, which are observable measures that stand in for these latent or omitted variables. Though useful, proxy variables must be used with care, as they introduce their own risks, most notably **measurement error** and **incomplete control of endogeneity**.

A **proxy variable** is an observed variable used in place of a variable that is either unobservable or omitted from a model. It is typically used under the assumption that it is correlated with the latent variable and explains some of its variation.

Let:

-   $X^*$ be the latent (unobserved) variable,

-   $X$ be the observed proxy,

-   $Y$ be the outcome.

We may desire to estimate: $$
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X^* + \varepsilon,
$$ but since $X^*$ is unavailable, we instead estimate:

$$
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + u.
$$

The effectiveness of this approach hinges on whether $X$ can validly stand in for $X^*$.

#### Proxy Use and Omitted Variable Bias

Proxy variables are sometimes used as **substitutes** for omitted variables that cause [endogeneity](#sec-endogeneity). Including a proxy can **reduce** endogeneity, but it will **not** generally eliminate bias, unless strict conditions are met.

> **Key Insight**: Including a proxy does not allow us to estimate the effect of the omitted variable; rather, it helps mitigate the bias introduced by its omission.

To be more precise, let's consider a classic omitted variable setup:

Suppose the true model is: $$
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \beta_2 Z + \varepsilon,
$$ but $Z$ is omitted from the estimation. If $Z$ is correlated with $X$, the OLS estimate of $\beta_1$ will be biased.

Now, suppose we have a proxy $Z_p$ for $Z$. Including $Z_p$ in the regression: $$
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \beta_2 Z_p + u
$$ can help reduce the bias **if** $Z_p$ meets the following criteria.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let $Z$ be the unobserved variable and $Z_p$ be the proxy. Then, $Z_p$ is a valid proxy if:

1.  **Correlation**: $Z_p$ is correlated with $Z$ (i.e., $\text{Cov}(Z_p, Z) \ne 0$).
2.  **Residual Independence**: The residual variation in $Z$ unexplained by $Z_p$ is uncorrelated with all regressors (including $Z_p$ and $X$): $$
    Z = \gamma_0 + \gamma_1 Z_p + \nu, \quad \text{where } \text{Cov}(\nu, X) = \text{Cov}(\nu, Z_p) = 0.
    $$
3.  **No direct effect**: $Z_p$ affects $Y$ only through $Z$ (or at least not directly).

Violation of these conditions can lead to **biased** or **inconsistent** estimates.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Example: IQ as a Proxy for Ability in Wage Regressions

In labor economics, researchers often study the effect of education on wages. But ability---an unobservable factor---also affects both education and wages, leading to omitted variable bias.

Let:

-   $Y$ = wage,

-   $X$ = education,

-   $Z^*$ = ability (unobserved),

-   $Z$ = IQ test score (proxy for ability).

Suppose the true model is: $$
\text{wage} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{education} + \beta_2 \text{ability} + \varepsilon.
$$

Since ability is unobserved, we estimate: $$
\text{wage} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{education} + \beta_2 \text{IQ} + u,
$$ under the assumption: $$
\text{ability} = \gamma_0 + \gamma_1 \text{IQ} + \nu,
$$ with $\text{Cov}(\nu, \text{education}) = \text{Cov}(\nu, \text{IQ}) = 0$.

This inclusion of IQ helps reduce [endogeneity](#sec-endogeneity) but does **not** identify the pure effect of ability unless all variation in ability is captured by IQ.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Pros and Cons of Proxy Variables

**Advantages**

-   **Make latent variables measurable**: Allows analysis of constructs that cannot be directly observed.
-   **Practicality**: Makes use of available data to address [endogeneity](#sec-endogeneity).
-   **Improved specification**: Can reduce omitted variable bias if proxies are well chosen.

**Disadvantages**

-   [Measurement error](#sec-measurement-error): Proxies usually include noise, causing **attenuation bias** (i.e., coefficients biased toward zero).

    If $X = X^* + \nu$, with $\nu$ classical measurement error (zero mean, uncorrelated with $X^*$ and $\varepsilon$), then: $$
    \text{plim}(\hat{\beta}_1) = \lambda \beta_1, \quad \text{where } \lambda = \frac{\sigma^2_{X^*}}{\sigma^2_{X^*} + \sigma^2_\nu} < 1.
    $$

-   **Interpretation issues**: Coefficients on proxies conflate the causal effect with proxy quality.

-   **Insufficient control**: Proxies only partially reduce omitted variable bias unless they meet strict independence conditions.

#### Empirical Illustration: Simulating Attenuation Bias


``` r
set.seed(2025)
n <- 1000
ability <- rnorm(n)                   # latent variable
IQ <- ability + rnorm(n, sd = 0.5)    # proxy variable
education <- 12 + 0.5 * ability + rnorm(n)  # correlated regressor
wage <- 20 + 1.5 * education + 2 * ability + rnorm(n)  # true model

# Model using education only (omitted variable bias)
mod1 <- lm(wage ~ education)

# Model using education and proxy
mod2 <- lm(wage ~ education + IQ)

```

Observe how including the proxy reduces the bias in the coefficient on education, even if it doesn't eliminate it entirely.

#### Example: Marketing --- Brand Loyalty

Suppose you're modeling the effect of brand loyalty ($X^*$) on repeat purchase ($Y$). Since loyalty is latent, we might use:

-   Number of prior purchases,
-   Duration of current brand use,
-   Membership in loyalty programs.

These proxies are likely to be correlated with true loyalty, but none is a perfect substitute.


``` r
# Simulating attenuation bias with a proxy
set.seed(42)
n <- 1000
X_star <- rnorm(n)  # true unobserved brand loyalty
proxy <- X_star + rnorm(n, sd = 0.6)  # proxy with measurement error
error <- rnorm(n)
Y <- 3 + 2 * X_star + error  # true model

# Model using the proxy variable
model_proxy <- lm(Y ~ proxy)
summary(model_proxy)
#> 
#> Call:
#> lm(formula = Y ~ proxy)
#> 
#> Residuals:
#>     Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max 
#> -4.3060 -1.0130 -0.0018  0.9131  4.5493 
#>

#> (Intercept)  2.98737    0.04584   65.17   <2e-16 ***
#> proxy        1.45513    0.03921   37.11   <2e-16 ***
#> ---
#> Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
#> 
#> Residual standard error: 1.449 on 998 degrees of freedom
#> Multiple R-squared:  0.5798,	Adjusted R-squared:  0.5794 
#> F-statistic:  1377 on 1 and 998 DF,  p-value: < 2.2e-16
```

Observe that the estimated coefficient on `proxy` is less than the true coefficient (2), due to [measurement error](#sec-measurement-error).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Example: Finance --- Investor Sentiment

Investor sentiment affects market movements but cannot be directly measured. Proxies include:

-   **Put-call ratios**

-   **Bullish/bearish sentiment surveys**,

-   **Volume of IPO activity**,

-   **Retail investor trading flows**.

These capture different dimensions of sentiment, and their effectiveness varies by context.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Strategies to Improve Proxy Use

-   **Multiple proxies**: Use several proxies and combine them via factor analysis or PCA

-   [Instrumental variables](#sec-instrumental-variables): If a valid instrument exists for the proxy, use two-stage least squares to correct for [measurement error](#sec-measurement-error).

-   **Latent variable models**: Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) allows estimation of models with latent variables explicitly.

Proxy variables are valuable tools in empirical research when used with caution. They offer a bridge between theory and data when important variables are unobservable. However, this bridge is built on assumptions---especially regarding correlation, measurement error, and residual independence---that must be carefully justified.

> **Key Takeaway**: A proxy can reduce bias from omitted variables but introduces its own risks---especially measurement error and interpretive ambiguity. The best practice is to use proxies transparently, test assumptions when possible, and consider alternative solutions such as instruments or structural models.
